Sleep & Mood AI is a web-based application designed to help users reflect on their sleep habits and daily mood through an interactive chat interface. The website asks users simple questions about how they slept and how they are feeling, then provides science-based feedback and practical suggestions to support healthier routines. By tracking responses over time and displaying trends in an easy-to-read chart, the site encourages users to better understand the relationship between sleep and mental well-being while keeping all personal data private to the user’s device.
